This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  It can manifest as `undefined` values for `width` and `height`, even when the component is mounted and the screen dimensions are available. This often happens when accessing `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` too early in the component's lifecycle, before the layout has been calculated and the dimensions are ready.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Width: {width}</Text>
      <Text>Height: {height}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```
